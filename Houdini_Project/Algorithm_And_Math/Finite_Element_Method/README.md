# 2D Finite Element Method

Finite element method(FEM) is a method solving the deformation of solid basing on solid mechanics. It descrete the whole body in to finite element, and each element approximately has a linear deformation. As is illustrated in the figure below, blue point is vertex that is fixed, and red arrow shows the force applied to the certain vertex. The 2D solid body character 'N' deforms as the applied force grow.

# Learning DirectX 11 in UE4
I integrate physics engine 'Chrono Engine' into UE4 as a plugin. This plguin provides great freedom and control when constructing scene where large amount and complex physics is involoved.

## Sample of My Works
Here are some simulation works of mine during undergraduate project. I use this plugin to construct the scene.

## How to use
There are two maps, which demonstrate the basic functionality of Rigidbody and Constraint.

# Acknowledgement
* [Chrono engine](https://projectchrono.org/) is a great physics engine, which provides lots of constraint type and special support for complex terrain.
* The blue four-legged robot in the second GIF above originates from Japanese anime 'Ghost in the Shell' TV series, . Their are Tachikoma,  intelligent robot with excellent mobility.

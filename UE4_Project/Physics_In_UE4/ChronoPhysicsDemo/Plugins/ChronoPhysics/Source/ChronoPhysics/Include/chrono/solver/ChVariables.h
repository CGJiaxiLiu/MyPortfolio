/// Each ChVariables object must be able to compute a mass submatrix,

/// Because of this there is no need for ChVariables and derived classes
/// to actually \e store their mass submatrix in memory:

/// Moreover, in some cases, the mass submatrix is not even needed.
/// In fact, some Chrono solvers are matrix-free. \n
/// This means that each ChVariables (and derived) object can be asked
/// not to \e assemble its mass submatrix,
/// but instead to provide operation related to it.\n
/// E.g. M*x, M\\x, +=M*x, and so on...

/// does \e not include any mass submatrix by default

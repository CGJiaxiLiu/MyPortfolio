# Computer Animation

This is the coursework in CS-7496 Computer Animation in Gatech, presented by professor Sehoon Ha. I learnt many thing I have always wanted to learn, mainly about physics-based-simulation.

<br />
Impulse based collision handle, basing on collision detection of Bullet physics engine.
